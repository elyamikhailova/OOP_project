Commands for Visual Novel
Every click event is a separate line in the file. The events below show how to call actions to make the chapter work.
Each line may have multiple actions. Actions on the same line should be delimited by a space. Because of this, no value,
including filenames, should contain spaces.

#DIALOGUE COMMANDS
#Make a character speak
    characterName "dialogue"                                                    ex: Chugdaan "bla bla bla"
    + symbol makes dialogue additive to continue from last segment.             ex: Chugdaan +"bla bla"
    No name before dialogue means use last speaker.                             ex: +"bla bla"

#USING DIALOGUE COMMANDS TAG
    {c} wait for input and clear
    {a} wait for input and append
    {w n} wait for n seconds and clear
    {wa n} wait for n seconds and append

#USING CHOICES AS EVENTS
  Every choice should be on its own line. A choice is not a regular event so it is not paired with dialogue.
  a choice begins with the word 'choice' to signify it is a choice and not a normal line.
  after choice have the choice title in quotes.
  then inside of squiggly brackets we have our choices in quotes followed by a single command to be executed if that choice is made.
                                                                                ex: choice "How are you doing?"
                                                                                    {
                                                                                      "Fine"
                                                                                        Chugdaan "That is good to hear."
                                                                                      "Terrible"
                                                                                        Chugdann "Oh? Why is that?"
                                                                                    }

#USING EVENTS INSIDE OF DIALOGUE
    events are conteined inside of brackets [].                                 ex: "Hello [showScene(true,blur)]everyone!"

    [txtSpd speed,charactersPerFrame] - change text architect speed             ex: "Let's move [txtSpd 15,2]slowly"
    [/txtSpd] - return architect to normal speed.                               ex: "Let's move [txtSpd 15,2]slowly [/txtSpd]but return to normal speed"

#Special Transitions For Layers and Overlay
use special transitions instead of normal fading to fade out entire scene or just change images on layer like the background
