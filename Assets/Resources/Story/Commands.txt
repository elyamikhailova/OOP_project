Commands for Visual Novel
Every click event is a separate line in the file. The events below show how to call actions to make the chapter work.
Each line may have multiple actions. Actions on the same line should be delimited by a space. Because of this, no value,
including filenames, should contain spaces.

#Make a character speak
    characterName "dialogue"                                                    ex: Chugdaan "bla bla bla"
    + symbol makes dialogue additive to continue from last segment.             ex: Chugdaan +"bla bla"
    No name before dialogue means use last speaker.                             ex: +"bla bla"
    
#Move character on screen
    move(characterName,targetLocationX,targetLocationY)                         ex: move(Chugdaan,0.3,0.7)
    
    *optional parameters
    1. speed of movement                                                        ex: move(Chugdaan,0.3,0.7,1.0)
